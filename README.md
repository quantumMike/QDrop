# QDrop

QDrop is a drag & drop quantum circuit tool that uses [qcircuit](https://github.com/CQuIC/qcircuit) from [CQuIQ](https://cquic.unm.edu). After the circuit diagram/schematic is complete, you can hit the compile button and it will autogenerate the corresponding LaTeX. 

The goal of QDrop is to create a fluid and clean interface for creating quantum circuits that removes a tedious component of writing papers and presentations.

The latest version of QDrop will be hosted on: http://qconnect.io. [qconnect.io is coming soon]

## Getting Started

The main website for [qcircuit](http://physics.unm.edu/CQuIC/Qcircuit/) can be found at: http://physics.unm.edu/CQuIC/Qcircuit/.  

Installation of qcircuit can be found at: https://github.com/CQuIC/qcircuit (consider reading the whitepaper).

This application uses [MEAN](http://mean.io), to run programs on your machine make sure MEAN is properly installed. 

## Deployment

The goal is maintain the latest developments of qcircuit. In addition to adding [qcircuitz](https://github.com/CQuIC/qcircuitz) which is similar to qcircuit but it utilizes Tikz for drawing the quantum circuit.

## Useful tools 

http://mean.io

The design tools utilized will be added soon.
